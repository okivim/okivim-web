# okivim-web Agent Instructions

## Working Style
- Keep explanations concise and pragmatic.
- Prefer MDX for homepage components when requested.

## Project Conventions
- Homepage lives at `src/pages/index.tsx`.
- Custom homepage components are under `src/components/`.
- Keep existing sections intact unless explicitly asked to remove them.
- Reuse existing UI patterns and libraries already in the project.

## Editing Guidelines
- Make minimal, targeted changes.
- Keep styles in CSS modules alongside the component.
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless the user explicitly approves.
